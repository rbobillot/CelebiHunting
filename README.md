Shiny Celebi Hunting - Pokemon Crystal VC
===

```
This program is meant to shiny hunt Celebi
in Pokemon Crystal VC (3DS).

As I counld't RNG abuse him (we don't have enough data for 2G yet),
I needed to soft reset him.
This task is quite repetitive, I did it many times for other generations.
But I got a life, a whole lotta work, and I found out in my 30's,
that sleeping is awesome (that's why I first got into RNG abuse).

Hense, my choice was to create a small robot, doing the job for me.

I first wanted to use a color sensor on the screen,
and wire my 2DS buttons to an Arduino.
But, the sensor was kinda broken... plus, this 2DS (with Pokemon Transporter and Bank),
is my only 2DS/3DS, and I didn't want to make a mess (not sure if the buttons wanted voltage was 1.8V or less or more).

Therefore, I came up with the idea of using two Servos to push the buttons / touch screen,
and a webcam detecting the Celebi color (using Python + OpenCV).
